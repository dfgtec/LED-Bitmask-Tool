# LED Bitmask Tool

The LED Bitmask Tool is a small Windows and Linux utility to help create custom bitmasks for use with 7-segment numeric, 14-segment alphanumeric and 8x8 matrix LED displays, especially those supplied by Adafruit. The tool lets you toggle display segments on and off and automatically updates the resulting bitmask which can be passed to the Adafruit libraries to drive the displays.

The three type of displays supported by the tool are:

- 4-Digit 7-Segment Numeric Display (see Adafruit product #879)
- 4-Digit Quad Alphanumeric Display (see Adafruit product #1911)
- 8x8 LED Matrix Display (see Adafruit product #870)
